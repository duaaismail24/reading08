Theoretically
 if we know the complete number of iterations we use for loop and if we don’t know the number of iterations; we use while loop.

Examples:

For example, we all use ATM and we want to end process ourselves. So, while coding when we want to end a process according to user desire, we will use while loop i.e. loop will keep running until user doesn’t terminate it.

One more example of while loop can be that if we have a situation of infinite iterations i.e. loop continues to run and never stops. A situation can be i want to print a welcome message at my office door all the time. so this will be an infinite loop that runs forever.

For loop example is i am limiting the user to use ATM 3 times once a card is inserted. Here, i know the number of iteration so i will use for loop.
